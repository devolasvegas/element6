Each time you post a new blog, it becomes one more indexed page of content on your website, which translates into more visibility. Even if the blog post is 6 months or 6 years old, it will still drive traffic to your business as long as the topics and keywords are of interest to your audience. Writing regularly results in an exponential growth of your web presence. As the blogs pile up, you reach more people and gain more traffic, leads and customers.
